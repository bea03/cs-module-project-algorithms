'''
Write a function that receives an array of integers and returns
an array consisting of the product of all numbers in the array
except the number at that index.
For example, given

[1, 7, 3, 4]

your function should return

[84, 12, 28, 21]

by calculating

[7*3*4, 1*3*4, 1*7*4, 1*7*3]

In the above example, the final value at index 0
is the product of every number in the input array
except the number at index 0.

Can you do this in O(n) time with O(1) space without using division?

    # Your code here
    #return a new array with products
    pro_arr = []

    #loop through once and place in pro_arr products
    


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Use the main function to test your implementation
    # arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    print(f"Output of product_of_all_other_numbers: {product_of_all_other_numbers(arr)}")
